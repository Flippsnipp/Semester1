                  Games turn students into active participants in the learning process, they provide the opportunity to influence and control
                   their surroundings, and allow for deep learning in a way that both makes and motivates.

          <h2>
            Join Matema - a solar system out of the ordinary!
          </h2>
          <p>
            Sometime in the future, long after humanity has explored other solar systems, a group of astronauts have disappeared into the distant
            solar system Matema. They went out to investigate a mysterious radio signal, but never returned. Therefore, the player must bring friends
            and family in the Magellan spaceship and travel to find the missing expedition.
          </p>
          <p>
            When they arrive, they immediately discover that Matema is not like any other solar system. The planets there have a mysterious
            energy field that means no computers work on the planet's surface. All calculation must therefore be done manually.
          </p>
          <img class="matemaimage" src="./resources/eduplaytion_media/graphics/matema.png" alt="Matema" />
          <p>
            Matema is not like any other solar system. The planets there have a mysterious energy field that means no computers work on the
            planet's surface.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the rescue team at Magellan is not alone! Aliens from across the galaxy have found their way to Matema and are in search of
            technology left behind by a lost people called the Zusites, who were known for their highly developed mathematical culture.
            Unfortunately, they have all left their calculations to advanced computers and artificial intelligence, so none of them are able
            to follow the clues or solve the Sussites' riddle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, humans are the only ones in the solar system to find out what has happened to the Zusites and their technology - and not
            least what it has to do with the lost expedition.

            <p>
              The challenges that must be solved in the game are presented in full by characters. The task itself creates major and visible
              changes in the game world. The players should not think about learning - just that they have fun! The goal is to capture the
              attention of the students by telling an engaging story with interactive characters in the lead roles.
            </p>
            <img class="mission" src="./resources/images/mission.jpg" alt="In Game Mission" />
            <p>
              The game transforms students into active participants in the learning process, gives them the opportunity to influence and control
              their surroundings, and allows for deep learning in a way that is both harmless and motivating. The gaming experience further
              contributes to attaching a meaningful context to the problems that make it far easier to understand than traditional classroom teaching.

              what they do.

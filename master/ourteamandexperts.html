      </h2>
      <p>
        For many students, the subjects at the school are first and foremost things to be pegged, and not something that is fun and interesting.
        Eduplaytion stands for learning through play and mastery, and wants students to discover and understand the meaning and purpose of what they do.
      </p>
      <p>
        To develop our solutions, we have brought together people of different backgrounds and nationalities, but with one common vision: to create
        entertaining gaming experiences that awaken the curiosity and learning will of children and adolescents.

        <p>
          For many students, the subjects at the school are first and foremost things to be pegged, and not something that is fun and interesting.
          Eduplaytion stands for learning through play and mastery, and wants students to discover and understand the meaning and purpose of what they do.
        </p>
        <img class="vision" src="./resources/images/vision.png" alt="Vision" />
        <p>
          To develop our solutions, we have brought together people of different backgrounds and nationalities, but with one common vision: to create
          entertaining gaming experiences that awaken the curiosity and learning will of children and adolescents.

          Today's children and young people are growing up in a digital revolution, where they are introduced
          to their first tablet long before they can talk or walk. Eight out of ten play video games regularly,
          and the 2017 Horizon report emphasizes that gaming and gamification are one of the things that will
          characterize school life in the near future. Eduplaytion now sits in the driver's seat when it comes
          to developing exciting games as a learning mode.
        </p>

        <p>
          The opportunities for providers of gaming-based learning solutions are now enormous, as the market is
          in a period of formidable growth. A 2018 report prepared by Metaari shows that the five-year compound
          growth rate worldwide is estimated to reach 37 percent, while earnings are estimated to quadruple from
          the current level. This will increase to NOK 140 billion by 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
          The math game Numetry will be Eduplaytion AS's first product and will be sold as a subscription service
          in the global market. The development is financed partly through public support schemes and private capital.
          The game is expected to go on sale in the Norwegian market in the fall of 2019, followed closely by an
          international launch. In connection with the latter, a capital increase is planned.
